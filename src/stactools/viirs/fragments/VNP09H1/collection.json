    "description": "The 8-day Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) surface reflectance Version 1 composite product provides an estimate of land surface reflectance from the VIIRS sensor for three imagery bands (I1, I2, I3) at nominal 500 meter resolution (~463 meter). The 500 meter dataset is derived through resampling the native 375 meter VIIRS resolution in the L2 input product. The data are corrected for atmospheric conditions such as the effects of molecular gases, including ozone and water vapor, and for the effects of atmospheric aerosols. Each pixel represents the best possible Level 2G observation during an 8-day period, which is selected on the basis of high observation coverage, low sensor angle, the absence of clouds or cloud shadow, and aerosol loading. In addition to the three reflectance bands, this product includes a state quality assurance (QA) band and a reflectance band quality band.",
